# SSTPA Tools

**Systems Security-Theoretic Process Analysis (SSTPA) Tool** — a Model-Based System
Security Engineering application that scales the SSTPA methodology (derived from
MIT's STPA by Nicholas Triska, 2025) to large, complex, hierarchical engineered systems.

SSTPA Tools models a system as a hierarchy of **Systems of Interest (SoI)** stored in a
Neo4j graph, and provides a desktop GUI plus a suite of Add-on Tools for security
analysis: asset/loss analysis with attack trees, STPA control structures, requirements
management, state analysis, use cases, NIST 800-53 / MITRE ATT&CK / ATLAS / EMB3D
reference integration, GSN assurance cases, and SysML 2.0 / KerML 1.0 interchange.

The authoritative specification is [`SSTPA Tool SRS V7.md`](SSTPA%20Tool%20SRS%20V7.md).

## Repository Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `backend/` | Go backend: REST API, Neo4j access, schema validation, telemetry |
| `frontend/` | Tauri + React + TypeScript desktop GUI and Add-on Tools |
| `startup/` | Startup Software: authenticates the user, starts Backend then Frontend |
| `installer/` | Installer build scripts (Windows / macOS / Linux) |
| `sustainment/` | Python reference-data pipeline (acquire → normalize → transform → validate → package) |
| `deploy/` | Docker Compose, Caddy, OTel Collector, Prometheus, Tempo, Grafana configuration |
| `docs/` | Architecture, SBOM, schema extracts, developer documentation |
| `Assets/` | SSTPA Tools logo artwork |

## Architecture (summary)

Four independently operable segments (SRS §2):

1. **Startup Software** — desktop launcher; authenticates the user against the Backend,
   starts the Backend (Docker Compose) and then the Frontend; coordinates clean shutdown.
2. **Backend** — Go service (chi router, neo4j driver, OpenTelemetry/Prometheus
   instrumentation) fronted by Caddy, persisting to Neo4j Community Edition, with
   telemetry via OTel Collector → Tempo and Prometheus → Grafana. Two Docker networks:
   `edge` (Caddy, Grafana dashboards) and `backend` (everything else).
3. **Frontend** — Tauri desktop application; React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS;
   single-window GUI (Branding / Control / SoI / Main panels + Data Drawer) with
   manifest-driven Add-on Tools in popup windows.
4. **Installer** — ships all of the above for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details and
[`docs/SBOM.md`](docs/SBOM.md) for the software bill of materials.

## Quick start (development)

```bash
# Backend stack (Neo4j, API, telemetry)
cd deploy && docker compose up -d

# Frontend (dev mode)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run tauri dev
```
